# Getting Started with landingpage
When I applied to Liana Technologies for internship role, I was given an entry task to create a website according to their Figma design. Using the given Figma design, this redesigned landing page for Liana Technologies was created.

- **Github link** - [https://github.com/jirimicvl/landingpage](https://github.com/jeresulovuo/landingpage_liana_tech)
- **Project deployed** via <a href="https://lianatechnologylandingpage.vercel.app/">vercel</a> - https://lianatechnologylandingpage.vercel.app/

# Feedback from Liana Technologies
> The task was implemented according requirements and also the extra's were implement. We asked to focus on and show off HTML and CSS skills, frameworks like React/Vue/Angular were not allowed. Jere was not afraid to be creative and even extended the assignment with his own implementation, which he did very well and thus he exceeded our expectations.
